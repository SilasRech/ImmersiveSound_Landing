								<h3>Effects</h3>
								<p>We used three effects to help turning a stereo song into an immersive one. A Lexicon PCM91 and a TC Electronic M3000 are known for their spatialness and a wave-plugin called PS22
									Mono to Stereo Enhancer Plugin with which we could change the direction of the sound based on the frequency.</p>

								<h3>Immersive Setup</h3>
								<p>In the background you can see our setup, which contained of 14 Genelec/L-Acoustic speakers and a Midas Pro-X. We used Dante and two computers for the recording, playback and the 3D-IEM-plugins.</p>

								<h3>The Song</h3>
								<p>The song was written by Joonas V채re and is called Hyv채 El채m채. The reference stereo song mixed by the artist can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYoAydOd4R1F5r5Hy2Iv6qQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
here. In total we able to place each of the 40 different tracks anywhere in space.

								<h3>Network Connection and Optimization of Plug-Ins</h3>
								<p>It turned out that the whole connection between console and computer via Dante was a major constrained for mixing and quality.
								The computer and then network speed itself should not have been a problem based on their usage but we could still hear glitches.</p>

								<h3>Lack of Plugins</h3>
								<p> For a shorter project there are almost no Plug-Ins to use for a more time-efficient approach. We seem to be at a point where we need tools to turn stereo sources into 3-D sources.
									We reporpused the wave plugin PS22 which turns a mono signal into a stereo one, this signal was frequency based and we used to it to pan the instrument up and down.

								<h2>Surprises</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>From a sound perception, the stero effects we used for reverbs were suitable for the use of 3-D sound, it was very
									difficult to hear the differences between spatialised and stereo reverbs. we panned the stereo reverb to the opposite side of the source to create the pereception of room. </p>

								<h3>The Javascript library was a major constraint in the publication of the song, as it only supports ambisonics in third order, based on the availability of the filters.
								It is not effective to stream pure audio with the data stream of a normal video.</h3>
